bad

Collection of scripts and kludges I've created to live with institutional e-learning systems - illustrating the BAD mindset

Inspried by the MAV project (https://github.com/damoclark/mav) and the ideas expressed in this paper (http://davidtjones.wordpress.com/2014/09/21/breaking-bad-to-bridge-the-realityrhetoric-chasm/) this project is an ad hoc collection of scripts (perhaps mostly Greasemonkey) scripts that I have developed to make my life teaching at Universities a little easier.

The value of these scripts beyond my practice is questionable.

gradebookFix.user.js
====================

A script that updates the Peoplesoft gradebook "cumulative grades" screen to indicate students that fall into "special cases" (defined by my institution) and that thus required manual changes to be made.

moreStudentDetails.user.js
==========================

Very early experiment in additing "more details" links to any user profile in a Moodle course site.  Requires a server to be installed which currently isn't shared.  So not real useful.
